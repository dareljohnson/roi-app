# Release Notes v2.0.0 - Production Deployment Success

**Release Date**: September 30, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… **PRODUCTION READY**

## ðŸŽ‰ Major Milestone Achieved

**The Real Estate Investment ROI App is now fully functional in production!**

After systematic resolution of multiple deployment challenges, the application is successfully running at **https://real-estate-roi-app.fly.dev** with full database functionality and user authentication.

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issue Resolved

### Volume Synchronization Bug Fix

**The Problem**: Users were unable to log in to the production application, receiving the error:
```
Login failed. Invalid `prisma.user.findUnique()` invocation: 
The table `main.users` does not exist in the current database.
```

**Root Cause**: Multiple Fly.io volumes with identical names (`database_vol`) were attached to different machines. The database seeding occurred on one volume while the active production machine was using an empty volume.

**The Solution**:

- Identified the volume mismatch between machines
- Successfully synchronized the database on the correct volume
- Applied all migrations and seeded the database with production data
- Cleaned up unused resources to prevent future conflicts
