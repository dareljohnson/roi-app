- **Features**:
  - Authentication required
  - Multiple file upload support
  - 10MB per file size limit
  - Image MIME type validation
  - Unique filename generation to prevent conflicts

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files

1. `src/components/walkthrough/PhotoUpload.tsx`
2. `src/app/api/upload/walkthrough-photos/route.ts`
3. `src/tests/walkthrough-form-photos-final.test.tsx`
4. `src/tests/photo-api-integration.test.ts`
5. `prisma/migrations/20251001212508_add_walkthrough_photos/`

### Modified Files

1. `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added WalkThroughPhoto model
2. `src/types/walkthrough.ts` - Enhanced with photo types
3. `src/components/walkthrough/WalkThroughNoteForm.tsx` - Photo integration
4. `src/app/api/walkthrough-notes/route.ts` - Photo support
5. `src/app/api/walkthrough-notes/[id]/route.ts` - Photo CRUD operations

## Deployment Considerations

### For fly.io Deployment

- **Volume Mount**: Ensure persistent volume for photo storage
- **Environment**: File upload works with existing SQLite + volume setup
- **Performance**: Consider CDN or cloud storage for production scaling

### Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Cloud Storage**: Integrate with AWS S3 or similar for scalability
2. **Image Processing**: Add thumbnail generation and image optimization
3. **Bulk Operations**: Support for bulk photo upload/management
4. **Photo Gallery**: Dedicated photo viewing interface
5. **Metadata Extraction**: EXIF data extraction for location/timestamp info
