### ✅ FLY.IO DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY (September 2025)

- Docker runtime image now includes bash in all stages to support Fly.io release_command
- Custom docker-entrypoint.sh script handles both release_command and normal Node.js startup
- Release command in fly.toml:
  [deploy]
  release_command = 'bash scripts/deploy-db.sh'
- scripts/deploy-db.sh handles:
  - Migration deploy for fresh or tracked DBs
  - Baseline resolve for existing schema not tracked by migrations
  - Fallback to db push/reset if needed
  - Conditional seeding
- Persistent volume mounted at /data, DATABASE_URL set to file:/data/production.db
- All deployment logic is additive—core application behavior unchanged
- Deployment tests in src/tests/deployment verify all strategies
- See README for troubleshooting and local verification steps
