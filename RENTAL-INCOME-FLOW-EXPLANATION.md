## Understanding the Rental Income Flow - **UPDATED with Consolidation Feature**

**✅ NEW**: As of the latest update, rental income entry has been consolidated for a better user experience!

### Current Workflow (Improved)
The application now allows you to enter rental amounts **directly on the Property Details tab**, eliminating the need to navigate through multiple steps just to enter your rental income.

#### For "Rent Entire House/Unit" Strategy:
1. **Property Details Tab**: 
   - Select "Rent Entire House/Unit" from the rental strategy dropdown
   - **Monthly Gross Rent input field appears immediately** 
   - Enter your rental amount (e.g., "2500" auto-formats to "2,500.00")
   - Complete other property details (address, price, bedrooms, etc.)

2. **Navigate Through Wizard**: 
   - Continue to Financing → Operating Expenses → Rental Income tabs
   - Your rental amount **automatically appears** on the Income tab (no re-entry needed!)

#### For "Rent Individual Rooms" Strategy:
1. **Property Details Tab**:
   - Select "Rent Individual Rooms" from the rental strategy dropdown
   - **Room configuration section appears**
   - Set number of rooms to rent and weekly rates for each room
   - Total monthly income automatically calculated from room rates

2. **Navigate Through Wizard**:
   - Your calculated room rental income **automatically appears** on the Income tab

### Key Benefits of the New Consolidation:
- ✅ **Enter rental amounts once** on Property Details tab
- ✅ **No duplicate entry** required on Income tab  
- ✅ **Immediate feedback** - see your rental amounts right after selecting strategy
- ✅ **Automatic calculations** for room rental scenarios
- ✅ **Consistent data flow** between tabs

### Why This Improved Design

The new consolidated approach provides several advantages:

- **Faster data entry**: Enter rental amounts immediately when selecting strategy
- **Better user experience**: No need to navigate through multiple tabs just to enter rent
- **Immediate validation**: See your rental inputs right after making strategy selection
- **Reduced errors**: Eliminates duplicate entry and potential inconsistencies
- **Logical grouping**: All rental strategy decisions and inputs are on the same tab

The wizard flow still ensures you provide all necessary information in logical order, but now rental income is collected where it makes the most sense contextually.

### What You'll See Now

#### On Property Details Tab
**For Entire House Strategy:**
- Monthly Gross Rent input field appears immediately after strategy selection
- Placeholder text shows "2,000.00"

#### On Income Tab
