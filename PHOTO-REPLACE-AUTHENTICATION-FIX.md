# Property Photo Upload Authentication Bug Fix

## Problem Summary

The "Replace Photo" feature was not working for logged-in users on the Property Summary page. Users reported being unable to replace property photos despite being authenticated.

## Root Cause Analysis

The `PropertyPhotoUpload` component was using a fake authentication system instead of the actual NextAuth session:

```typescript
// BUG: Fake authentication check using sessionStorage
const isAuthenticated = !!window.sessionStorage.getItem('userEmail');
```

This fake authentication check was always returning `false` for properly authenticated users, causing the Replace Photo button to be disabled.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Authentication Check

**File:** `src/components/property/PropertyPhotoUpload.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// Used fake sessionStorage authentication
const isAuthenticated = !!window.sessionStorage.getItem('userEmail');
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Import proper NextAuth hook
import { useSession } from 'next-auth/react';

// Use real authentication system
const { data: session, status } = useSession();
const isAuthenticated = status === 'authenticated' && !!session?.user;
```

### 2. Updated Authentication Logic

The component now properly integrates with NextAuth's session management system, ensuring that:
- Only authenticated users can upload/replace photos
- The authentication status is accurately reflected in the UI
- The component respects the existing authentication flow

## Testing Verification

### PropertyPhotoUpload Component Tests

- ✅ All 7 existing tests pass with new authentication system
- ✅ Authentication check works correctly
- ✅ Upload, replace, and remove functionality intact
- ✅ Mobile detection still working
- ✅ File validation continues to work

### Integration Tests

- ✅ Created new integration test suite for ResultsDashboard photo functionality
- ✅ All 5 integration tests pass
- ✅ Verified proper callback handling between components
- ✅ Confirmed login prompt shows for unauthenticated users

### Full Test Suite

- ✅ 393 tests passing, 3 unrelated failures
- ✅ No regressions introduced by authentication fix
- ✅ Photo upload functionality fully restored

## Impact Assessment

### Fixed Issues

1. **Replace Photo Feature**: Now works correctly for logged-in users
2. **Authentication Flow**: Proper integration with NextAuth session management
3. **User Experience**: Users can now replace property photos as expected
4. **Security**: Removed fake authentication placeholder with real system

### No Breaking Changes

- All existing functionality preserved
- Test suite remains stable
- No impact on other components
- Backward compatible with existing data

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/property/PropertyPhotoUpload.tsx` - Fixed authentication logic
2. `src/tests/results-dashboard-photo-integration.test.tsx` - Added integration tests

## Next Steps

- ✅ Authentication bug resolved
- ✅ Tests verify functionality works correctly
- ✅ Integration confirmed with ResultsDashboard
- ✅ No regressions detected

The Replace Photo feature is now fully functional for authenticated users on the Property Summary page.
